Originally a reupload of SmartSteamEmu version 1.4.3 with LifeSupportPlguin and SSEComfy launcher. This has been updated with SmartSteamEmu 1.4.7 included, with the discontinued, but still works SmartSteamEmu Comfy launcher.

SSEComfy has slightly more features than the original SSE Launcher, here are the features:

* Log cleaning on startup
* Per game debug logging switch
* DLC list import from clipboard using the "dlc id=name" format found in most emulators.
* DLC list clearing

Please note that all issues will be ignored as SSEComfy was not updated for very long time, and I don't know much about coding so bugs related to SSEComfy will likely be not fixed. For other-SSE related bugs, please report it on [https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=62935](cs.rin.ru) website.
